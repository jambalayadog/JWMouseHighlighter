# JWsMouseHighlighter

Brings attention to the mouse!

This was a fun little project over the weekend. I was using another mouse highlighter app that requires extra steps and isn't quite as robust, so I decided to write a replacement. I get asked occassionally about this highlighter app and it seemed like a nice small project to practice coding and make something shareable.
 
 What it do:
 * Creates a circular highlighter around your mouse cursor
 * Creates a temporary marker wherever you left click
 * Runs in System Tray, can start with Windows

 Customizing highlight and click marker:
 * Radius
 * Color
 * Transparency
 * Number of Markers and Duration

Use the Installer, or grab the Python + included icons if you want to go rogue.

Ideas for future:
* Customize update speed (currently 10ms) or remove lag entirely
* Code sign and put on Microsoft Store
* Make it look nicer
* ???
