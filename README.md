# JWsMouseHighlighter

This was a fun little project over the weekend.  
I have a similar app that requires extra steps to setup and isn't quite as robust, so I decided to write a replacement.  
I get asked occassionally about this feature and it seemed like a nice small project to practice coding.
 
 What it do:
 * Creates a circular highlighter around your mouse cursor
 * Creates a temporary marker wherever you left click
 * Runs in System Tray

 Customizing highlight and click marker:
 * Radius
 * Color
 * Transparency
 * + more

Installer included.

Python + icons included if you want to go rogue.

Ideas for future:
* customize update speed (currently 10ms)
* remove lag entirely
